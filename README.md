# 🌙 Dreamify

**Dreamify** is a tiny, experimental AI-powered dream interpreter.

It doesn't try to decode your dreams — it plays with them. This isn't your average productivity tool. It's more of a late-night companion, designed to stir emotion, curiosity, and reflection.

Whether you're looking for some introspective fun or just bored at 3AM with a weird dream to explore — Dreamify's here for it.

## 🤯 Why I Built This

Got bored of the daily grind — DSA, dev tutorials, and never-ending freelance cycles. So I built something purely for fun. No tutorials, no strict plan. Just me, some UI libraries, and the freedom to play.

Not built to go viral. Just built to feel something.
